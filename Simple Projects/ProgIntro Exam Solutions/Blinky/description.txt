In the Pac-Man universe, Blinky is the red ghost who
persistently chases the game's hero, earning the
nickname "Shadow" for his relentless pursuit.
Blinky's strategy intensifies as Pac-Man consumes
more dots, making Blinky a formidable challenge and
a central figure in game strategy. His vivid red hue
not only marks Blinky as the primary antagonist but
also signals the immediate threat he poses.
